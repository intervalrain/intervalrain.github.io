You will be expected to come up with optimized and production-ready code, free of bugs. You should not write in pseudo-code.\nI would highly recommend watching this video first to get a good grasp of the tips/ideas/areas of focus for the interviews here at Google. Do then read the next part to concretise these interview tips.\nRefresh yourself with CS fundamentals We do expect you to know a lot about algorithms and data structures and especially be able to implement them into your solutions - there is a great bigocheatsheet that may also help you! Steve Yegge’s Blog Google Style Guides (C++) Geek for Geeks - Study algorithms and data structure System Design resources: System design interview tip! Hired in Tech Coding Practice + CS review When you practice, do not use an IDE. You need to be able to write legible, compilable code without help with regards to layout, or spelling of standard library class/method names. I suggest solving similar style algorithmic/ DS problems on a google document or on paper to simulate a real interview. Several sites that provide similar problems to those typically asked in the interview are:\nLeetcode Code Jam Kickstart - great practice to get a glimpse of Google coding and algorithm questions. Code Jam hosts online Kickstart rounds that give participants the opportunity to test and grow their coding abilities! Participate in one—or join them all! You can also learn how to solve those problems by reading our analysis Codeforces HackerRank Topcoder ACM-ICPC Code Jam Below are some tips for your Coding Rounds: Write very clean, well-structured code and proactively address potential errors. Exhibit advanced coding approach (e.g. may have conducted exhaustive error-checking for boundary conditions, use appropriate idiomatic constructs in code, etc.\nTest covered several corner cases, tests are simple but thorough - (dependency injection, no static cling, etc.)\nIdentify data structures to design a solution with optimal efficiency.\nPropose multiple algorithmic approaches to single and compound problems.\nIdentify an optimal solution for given time-space tradeoffs.\nPropose novel, creative algorithmic solutions or come up with alternative optimal solutions for different constraints.\nCreate a workable design for a complex problem using a sound problem solving approach (e.g., gathered requirements, identified solutions, mapped solutions to design, understand constraints and trade-offs, estimated unknowns reasonably)\nShow robust comprehension of problems, identifying supplemental contingencies/challenges. Provide examples and/or alternative explanations to clarify rationale. Communicate code/algorithms/etc. in a way that leaves no room for confusion.\nTranslate ideas into code/action without the need for revision. Proactively identify and provide solutions for additional considerations beyond the initial problem, expanding the complexity/scope of solution.\nImportant areas of assessment Coding - Good code quality (No IDE. Fully functional code. Take care of syntax, good language constructs, clean and concise code) \u0026 coding fast (you can code in Codechef timed challenges to practise coding under time pressure)\nDS \u0026 Algo - Refer to below topics on what we are assessing for\nGood communication - Talk out loud, explain your thought process to the interviewer\nAttitude - Being independent, lead/drive the discussion forward while being receptive to hints from interviewers and integrating it in your solution\nSpeed of solving the question (Ideally 20mins per question - refer to below notes on time allocation)\nStrategy for Success (Framework) Step 1: Clarify the problem Step 2: Define your approach Step 3: Propose a solution Propose a solution before coding. Feel free to say that your first solution will be refined later Run through at least one or two examples to check for correctness Use reasonable variable names or clean up the code after the first pass Ask if the interviewer has any questions before refinement Step 4: Propose an alternative solution Step 5: Implementation Time Allocation During Interview (Suggestion from Googlers for your reference) + Solve 1 question in 20 mins + 2 mins for gathering all requirements and asking clarifying questions from the interviewer. + Approx 8-10 mins for coming up with a valid solution to the question, discuss with the interviewer about your solution, trade offs, the time and space complexity. + 5 mins for coding the solution. + 5 mins for dry run (sample test cases) along with discussion with the interviewer. Breakdown of Framework Tip 1: Think out Loud \u0026 Communicate your Thought Process\nGoogle interviewers are assessing you based on your problem solving skills, and want to know your full thought process behind why and how you derived the final result\nTalk through your entire thought process \u0026 explain about your approach, how you derive a certain algorithm, explain the trade offs, and discuss the complexity of the solutions you are proposing and explain your code (Talk and Code).\nMost important would be to pick the right data structure and algorithm for a specific problem! Talk about how they’re implemented and why you’d choose one implementation or data structure instead of another.\nDo not mumble to yourself or keep silent when thinking.\nTip 2: Ask Clarifying Questions (Very Important!)\nNever jump straight and code up the solution. Always take a pause, look at the interview question and ask some clarifying questions\nThese clarifying questions should enable you to cover for edge/boundary cases better and to define the scope of the question. Eg:“Describe a good algorithm for sorting a million numbers”\nGood Clarifying Questions: What is the range of the numbers? How are they distributed? Are the numbers integers or floating points? How much memory is available? Are there duplicates? Tip 3: Discuss algorithmic complexities \u0026 Identify all Edge Cases Independently\nFor Algorithms, you will need to know big-o notation very well.\nAlways state time and space complexities upfront. Think of how you can reduce the complexity further to reach an optimised solution!\nDistinguish between average case/worst case runtime\nConsider amortized time complexities!\nThe goal is to reach the most optimised solution at the end of the interview, and to have a complete working solution.\nTip 4: Test your Code\nCheck for boundary conditions!\nStress tests to ensure that the code runs within time constraint\nCreate tests that have 100% code coverage\nRectify any bugs in your code before the interviewer points it out\nTip 5: Ensure Good Code Quality on Google Docs\nYou are expected to code in Google Docs. Since it does not have any IDE, you are expected to type out your code from scratch\nType as close to fully functional code as possible. This code should be maintainable and readable by a large database of engineers\nCode in the latest version of your preferred language and use appropriate language constructs. Take care of variable names and syntax.\nDo not use Pseudo code or shortcuts, it is not good enough.\nAlways cover for Edge/Boundary cases\nTip 6: Positive \u0026 Independent Attitude \u0026 Being Open to Feedback\nIf you get stuck, stay calm, asking questions can help to reduce the scope of the problem.\nAim to solve as much independently as possible, ideally with as few hints as possible.\nAlways take the initiative in the interview, and treat it like a technical discussion.\nListen attentively to the interviewer, and integrate the hints/suggestions by the interviewer to your solution.\nInterview Preparation Plan (created by Google Software Engineers) Revise all concepts on data structures \u0026 algorithms- you can also use this gitHub link on CS fundamentals that can serve as a checklist while preparing. This BigO cheat sheet http://bigocheatsheet.com/ could help you as well!\nStructured Revision plan on the topics that to cover (Eg. hashtable, hashmaps, trees, arrays, strings, graphs, dynamic programming and more)\nPractise per category\nPractice up to a level that you reach competency - Solve the question in 20/40 minutes (for medium and hard problems respectively) and come up with the optimal solutions\nPractice Problem Identification by picking random problems and practice identifying “Which category does this problem belong to? Backtracking/Dynamic programming? Solution/Algorithmic design?”.\nPractice coding without an IDE, be familiar with the differences in how you should write code in Google Docs. Do practise coding in Google Docs within a set time frame and getting comfortable talking while coding.\nIn summary: Practise a wide variety of questions, and simulate actual interview conditions! You can also run mock interviews here at pramp.com\nFrequently asked topics (in no particular order) Binary search\nBFS/DFS/Flood fill\nTree traversals\nHash tables\nLinked list, stacks, queues, two pointers/sliding window\nBinary heaps\nDynamic programming\nUnion find\nAd hoc/string manipulations\nOther good to know topics: Trie, segment trees/fenwick trees, bitmask\nGoogle Interview Style Guides (C++, Python, Java; Javascript)\nYou’ll be expected to know and apply: lists, maps, stacks, priority queues, binary trees, graphs, bags, and sets.\nFor algorithms you’ll want to know greedy algorithms, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, recursion, and brute force search.\nYou’ll definitely want to be conversant with big­O notation, time­-space complexity, and real world performance of all of this.\nWhat we are assessing for Data Structures \u0026 Algorithms Can you implement the most optimized data structure and algorithm for the question?\nCan you explain the tradeoffs between the data structure/solution?\nCan you explain why you choose a data structure for implementation\nCan you explain and analyze the time and space complexity correctly\nCan you translate the algorithm to code well?\nSystem Design Tips System Design assesses a candidate’s ability to combine knowledge, theory, experience and judgement toward solving a real-world engineering problem with significant ambiguity.\nSystems Design questions are about learning from your experience and applying those lessons to future projects. We are looking for you to be able to:\nClarify the problem - System Design questions are deliberately underspecified, and we expect candidates to understand where the gaps are and ask followup questions, just like in a real project, where you have to probe to find the boundaries of the problem space.\nBreak down a complex problem into parts, and be able to discuss the overall design at both a high level and to do a deep dive into how a component in your system works. Note you will likely have to dig deeper into the problem initially presented to clarify details and understand resource requirements and limitations.\nIdentify and analyze tradeoffs in your design, understanding what the implications are. Note that we are more interested in seeing that you understand the implications of the various tradeoffs you make in your design – we want to see a coherent design rather than evaluating if specific tradeoffs are “correct” or not.\nRecovering from failure. Things go wrong in real life. At large scale they can happen more often. How do you detect and defend against failures?\nAvoid answers, which involve “use a standard database and do queries against it;” we’re not looking for answers involving off-the-shelf products, rather how do you build from scratch?

Talk about how they&rsquo;re implemented and why you&rsquo;d choose one implementation or data structure instead of another.</p></li><li><p>Do not mumble to yourself or keep silent when thinking.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tip 2: Ask Clarifying Questions (Very Important!)</p><ul><li><p>Never jump straight and code up the solution. Always take a pause, look at the interview question and ask some clarifying questions</p></li><li><p>These clarifying questions should enable you to cover for edge/boundary cases better and to define the scope of the question. Eg:&ldquo;Describe a good algorithm for sorting a million numbers&rdquo;</p><ul><li>Good Clarifying Questions:<ul><li>What is the range of the numbers? How are they distributed? Are the numbers integers or floating points? How much memory is available? Are there duplicates?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Tip 3: Discuss algorithmic complexities & Identify all Edge Cases Independently</p><ul><li><p>For Algorithms, you will need to know big-o notation very well.</p></li><li><p>Always state time and space complexities upfront. Think of how you can reduce the complexity further to reach an optimised solution!</p></li><li><p>Distinguish between average case/worst case runtime</p></li><li><p>Consider amortized time complexities!</p></li><li><p>The goal is to reach the most optimised solution at the end of the interview, and to have a complete working solution.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tip 4: Test your Code</p><ul><li><p>Check for boundary conditions!</p></li><li><p>Stress tests to ensure that the code runs within time constraint</p></li><li><p>Create tests that have 100% code coverage</p></li><li><p>Rectify any bugs in your code before the interviewer points it out</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tip 5: Ensure Good Code Quality on Google Docs</p><ul><li><p>You are expected to code in Google Docs. Since it does not have any IDE, you are expected to type out your code from scratch</p></li><li><p>Type as close to fully functional code as possible. This code should be maintainable and readable by a large database of engineers</p></li><li><p>Code in the latest version of your preferred language and use appropriate language constructs. Take care of variable names and syntax.</p></li><li><p>Do not use Pseudo code or shortcuts, it is not good enough.</p></li><li><p>Always cover for Edge/Boundary cases</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Tip 6: Positive & Independent Attitude & Being Open to Feedback</p><ul><li><p>If you get stuck, stay calm, asking questions can help to reduce the scope of the problem.</p></li><li><p>Aim to solve as much independently as possible, ideally with as few hints as possible.</p></li><li><p>Always take the initiative in the interview, and treat it like a technical discussion.</p></li><li><p>Listen attentively to the interviewer, and integrate the hints/suggestions by the interviewer to your solution.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=interview-preparation-plan-created-by-google-software-engineers><em>Interview Preparation Plan (created by Google Software Engineers)</em><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#interview-preparation-plan-created-by-google-software-engineers>#</a></h3><ol><li><p>Revise all concepts on data structures & algorithms- you can also use this <a href=https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university/blob/master/README.md#google-interview-university>gitHub link</a> on CS fundamentals that can serve as a checklist while preparing.

We are looking for you to be able to:</p><ul><li><p>Clarify the problem - System Design questions are deliberately underspecified, and we expect candidates to understand where the gaps are and ask followup questions, just like in a real project, where you have to probe to find the boundaries of the problem space.</p></li><li><p>Break down a complex problem into parts, and be able to discuss the overall design at both a high level and to do a deep dive into how a component in your system works. Note you will likely have to dig deeper into the problem initially presented to clarify details and understand resource requirements and limitations.</p></li><li><p>Identify and analyze tradeoffs in your design, understanding what the implications are. Note that we are more interested in seeing that you understand the implications of the various tradeoffs you make in your design &ndash; we want to see a coherent design rather than evaluating if specific tradeoffs are “correct” or not.</p></li><li><p>Recovering from failure. Things go wrong in real life. At large scale they can happen more often. How do you detect and defend against failures?</p></li><li><p>Avoid answers, which involve &ldquo;use a standard database and do queries against it;&rdquo; we&rsquo;re not looking for answers involving off-the-shelf products, rather how do you build from scratch?
