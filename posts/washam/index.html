After going through this study plan, I got hired as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon! You probably won’t have to study as much as I did. Anyway, everything you need is here.\nI studied about 8-12 hours a day, for several months. This is my story: Why I studied full-time for 8 months for a Google interview\nPlease Note: You won’t need to study as much as I did. I wasted a lot of time on things I didn’t need to know. More info about that below. I’ll help you get there without wasting your precious time.\nThe items listed here will prepare you well for a technical interview at just about any software company, including the giants: Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.\nBest of luck to you!\nWhat is it? This is my multi-month study plan for becoming a software engineer for a large company.\nRequired:\nA little experience with coding (variables, loops, methods/functions, etc) Patience Time Note this is a study plan for software engineering, not web development. Large software companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft view software engineering as different from web development. For example, Amazon has Frontend Engineers (FEE) and Software Development Engineers (SDE). These are 2 separate roles and the interviews for them will not be the same, as each has its own competencies. These companies require computer science knowledge for software development/engineering roles.\nTable of Contents The Study Plan What is it? Why use it? How to use it Don’t feel you aren’t smart enough A Note About Video Resources Choose a Programming Language Books for Data Structures and Algorithms Interview Prep Books Don’t Make My Mistakes What you Won’t See Covered The Daily Plan Coding Question Practice Coding Problems Topics of Study Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis Data Structures Arrays Linked Lists Stack Queue Hash table More Knowledge Binary search Bitwise operations Trees Trees - Notes \u0026 Background Binary search trees: BSTs Heap / Priority Queue / Binary Heap balanced search trees (general concept, not details) traversals: preorder, inorder, postorder, BFS, DFS Sorting selection insertion heapsort quicksort merge sort Graphs directed undirected adjacency matrix adjacency list traversals: BFS, DFS Even More Knowledge Recursion Dynamic Programming Design Patterns Combinatorics (n choose k) \u0026 Probability NP, NP-Complete and Approximation Algorithms How computers process a program Caches Processes and Threads Testing String searching \u0026 manipulations Tries Floating Point Numbers Unicode Endianness Networking Final Review Getting the Job Update Your Resume Find a Job Interview Process \u0026 General Interview Prep Be thinking of for when the interview comes Have questions for the interviewer Once You’ve Got The Job —————- Everything below this point is optional —————-\nOptional Extra Topics \u0026 Resources Additional Books System Design, Scalability, Data Handling (if you have 4+ years experience) Additional Learning Compilers Emacs and vi(m) Unix command line tools Information theory Parity \u0026 Hamming Code Entropy Cryptography Compression Computer Security Garbage collection Parallel Programming Messaging, Serialization, and Queueing Systems A* Fast Fourier Transform Bloom Filter HyperLogLog Locality-Sensitive Hashing van Emde Boas Trees Augmented Data Structures Balanced search trees AVL trees Splay trees Red/black trees 2-3 search trees 2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees) N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees B-Trees k-D Trees Skip lists Network Flows Disjoint Sets \u0026 Union Find Math for Fast Processing Treap Linear Programming Geometry, Convex hull Discrete math Machine Learning Additional Detail on Some Subjects Video Series Computer Science Courses Papers Why use it? If you want to work as a software engineer for a large company, these are the things you have to know.\nIf you missed out on getting a degree in computer science, like I did, this will catch you up and save four years of your life.\nWhen I started this project, I didn’t know a stack from a heap, didn’t know Big-O anything, or anything about trees, or how to traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible. Every data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn’t know how they worked under the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an “out of memory” error, and then I’d have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and thousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch.\nIt’s a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\nHow to use it Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\nI’m using GitHub’s special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.\nCreate a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]\nFork a branch and follow the commands below Fork the GitHub repo https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university by clicking on the Fork button.\nClone to your local repo:\ngit clone git@github.com:/coding-interview-university.git git checkout -b progress git remote add jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university git fetch --all Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:\ngit add . git commit -m \"Marked x\" git rebase jwasham/main git push --set-upstream origin progress git push --force More about GitHub-flavored markdown\nDon’t feel you aren’t smart enough Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren’t smart enough. The myth of the Genius Programmer It’s Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech A Note About Video Resources Some videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs. Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources, such as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people can study these anytime, not just when a specific online course is in session.\nChoose a Programming Language You’ll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do, but you’ll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts.\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one.\nFor this Study Plan When I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\nC: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that’s terrific, but when you’re learning how these low-level data structures are built, it’s great to feel close to the metal. C is everywhere. You’ll see examples in books, lectures, videos, everywhere while you’re studying. The C Programming Language, Vol 2 This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little you’ll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work. You don’t need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you’re comfortable reading and writing in C. Answers to questions in the book Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it’s just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview. This is my preference. You do what you like, of course.\nYou may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:\nExercism Codewars Codility HackerEarth Sphere Online Judge (spoj) Codechef Codeforces For your Coding Interview You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\nC++ Java Python You could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:\nJavaScript Ruby Here is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview: Pick One Language for the Coding Interview. This is the original article my post was based on: http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\nRead more about choices:\nChoose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview See language-specific resources here\nBooks for Data Structures and Algorithms This book will form your foundation for computer science.\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with. You’ll be doing a lot of reading and coding.\nC Algorithms in C, Parts 1-5 (Bundle), 3rd Edition Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching, and Graph Algorithms Python Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Goodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser I loved this book. It covered everything and more. Pythonic code my glowing book report: https://startupnextdoor.com/book-report-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-python/ Java Your choice:\nGoodrich, Tamassia, Goldwasser Data Structures and Algorithms in Java Sedgewick and Wayne: Algorithms Free Coursera course that covers the book (taught by the authors!): Algorithms I Algorithms II C++ Your choice:\nGoodrich, Tamassia, and Mount Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, 2nd Edition Sedgewick and Wayne Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4: Fundamentals, Data Structure, Sorting, Searching Algorithms in C++ Part 5: Graph Algorithms Interview Prep Books You don’t need to buy a bunch of these. Honestly “Cracking the Coding Interview” is probably enough, but I bought more to give myself more practice. But I always do too much.\nI bought both of these. They gave me plenty of practice.\nProgramming Interviews Exposed: Coding Your Way Through the Interview, 4th Edition Answers in C++ and Java This is a good warm-up for Cracking the Coding Interview Not too difficult. Most problems may be easier than what you’ll see in an interview (from what I’ve read) Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition answers in Java If you have tons of extra time: Choose one:\nElements of Programming Interviews (C++ version) Elements of Programming Interviews in Python Elements of Programming Interviews (Java version) - Companion Project - Method Stub and Test Cases for Every Problem in the Book Don’t Make My Mistakes This list grew over many months, and yes, it got out of hand.\nHere are some mistakes I made so you’ll have a better experience. And you’ll save months of time.\n1. You Won’t Remember it All I watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn’t remember. I spent 3 days going through my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn’t need all of that knowledge.\nPlease, read so you won’t make my mistakes:\nRetaining Computer Science Knowledge.\n2. Use Flashcards To solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code. Each card has different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.\nMake your own for free:\nFlashcards site repo I DON’T RECOMMEND using my flashcards. There are too many and many of them are trivia that you don’t need.\nBut if you don’t want to listen to me, here you go:\nMy flash cards database (1200 cards): My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards): Keep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. It’s way too much for what’s required.\nNote on flashcards: The first time you recognize you know the answer, don’t mark it as known. You have to see the same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in your brain.\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is Anki, which has been recommended to me numerous times. It uses a repetition system to help you remember. It’s user-friendly, available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system. It costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks @xiewenya).\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open deck, edit card, click cards, select the “styling” radio button, add the member “white-space: pre;” to the card class.\n3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You’re Learning THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\nStart doing coding interview questions while you’re learning data structures and algorithms.\nYou need to apply what you’re learning to solving problems, or you’ll forget. I made this mistake.\nOnce you’ve learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, linked lists:\nOpen one of the coding interview books (or coding problem websites, listed below) Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists. Move on to the next learning topic. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems. Do this with each new topic you learn. Keep doing problems while you’re learning all this stuff, not after.\nYou’re not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\n4. Focus There are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music without lyrics and you’ll be able to focus pretty well.\nWhat you won’t see covered These are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\nSQL Javascript HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies The Daily Plan This course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation of that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course.\nYou can see my code here:\nC C++ Python You don’t need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to understand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\nCoding Question Practice Why is this here? I'm not ready to interview. Then go back and read this.\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\nProblem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in Gathering requirements for the problem Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O below) Testing your solutions There is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview. You’ll get this from the programming interview books, too, but I found this outstanding: Algorithm design canvas\nWrite code on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer. Test with some sample inputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer.\nIf you don’t have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an art store. You can sit on the couch and practice. This is my “sofa whiteboard”. I added the pen in the photo just for scale. If you use a pen, you’ll wish you could erase. Gets messy quick. I use a pencil and eraser.\nCoding question practice is not about memorizing answers to programming problems.\nCoding Problems Don’t forget your key coding interview books here.\nSolving Problems:\nHow to Find a Solution How to Dissect a Topcoder Problem Statement Coding Interview Question Videos:\nIDeserve (88 videos) Tushar Roy (5 playlists) Super for walkthroughs of problem solutions Nick White - LeetCode Solutions (187 Videos) Good explanations of solution and the code You can watch several in a short time FisherCoder - LeetCode Solutions Challenge sites:\nLeetCode My favorite coding problem site. It’s worth the subscription money for the 1-2 months you’ll likely be preparing. See Nick White and FisherCoder Videos above for code walk-throughs. HackerRank TopCoder Geeks for Geeks InterviewBit Project Euler Let’s Get Started Alright, enough talk, let’s learn!\nBut don’t forget to do coding problems from above while you learn!\nAlgorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis Nothing to implement here, you’re just watching videos and taking notes! Yay! There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review. Don’t worry if you don’t understand all the math behind it. You just need to understand how to express the complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O. Harvard CS50 - Asymptotic Notation (video) Big O Notations (general quick tutorial) (video) Big O Notation (and Omega and Theta) - best mathematical explanation (video) Skiena: video slides UC Berkeley Big O (video) Amortized Analysis (video) TopCoder (includes recurrence relations and master theorem): Computational Complexity: Section 1 Computational Complexity: Section 2 Cheat sheet Well, that’s about enough of that.\nWhen you go through “Cracking the Coding Interview”, there is a chapter on this, and at the end there is a quiz to see if you can identify the runtime complexity of different algorithms. It’s a super review and test.\nData Structures Arrays About Arrays: Arrays (video) UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video) (Start watching from 15m 32s) Dynamic Arrays (video) Jagged Arrays (video) Implement a vector (mutable array with automatic resizing): Practice coding using arrays and pointers, and pointer math to jump to an index instead of using indexing.

I don’t recommend this list traversal style. Readability and maintainability suffer due to cleverness. Pointers to Pointers Implement (I did with tail pointer \u0026 without): size() - returns number of data elements in list empty() - bool returns true if empty value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first) push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list pop_front() - remove front item and return its value push_back(value) - adds an item at the end pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value front() - get value of front item back() - get value of end item insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index erase(index) - removes node at given index value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list reverse() - reverses the list remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value Doubly-linked List Description (video) No need to implement Stack Stacks (video) Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial Queue Queue (video) Circular buffer/FIFO Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer: enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front) empty() Implement using fixed-sized array: enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element empty() full() Cost: a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n) because you’d need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing]) dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array) empty: O(1) (linked list and array) Hash table Videos:\nHashing with Chaining (video) Table Doubling, Karp-Rabin (video) Open Addressing, Cryptographic Hashing (video) PyCon 2010: The Mighty Dictionary (video) PyCon 2017: The Dictionary Even Mightier (video) (Advanced) Randomization: Universal \u0026 Perfect Hashing (video) (Advanced) Perfect hashing (video) Online Courses:\nCore Hash Tables (video) Data Structures (video) Phone Book Problem (video) distributed hash tables: Instant Uploads And Storage Optimization In Dropbox (video) Distributed Hash Tables (video) Implement with array using linear probing\nhash(k, m) -

This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky. I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root.” - Skiena\nOf these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I’ve read, you won’t implement a balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up and let’s face it, splay trees are the bee’s knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code\nSplay tree: insert, search, delete functions If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these: Search and insertion functions, skipping delete I want to learn more about B-Tree since it’s used so widely with very large data sets\nSelf-balancing binary search tree\nAVL trees\nIn practice: From what I can tell, these aren’t used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter) MIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort (video) AVL Trees (video) AVL Tree Implementation (video) Split And Merge Splay trees\nIn practice: Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors, data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory, networking and file system code) etc CS 61B: Splay Trees (video) MIT Lecture: Splay Trees: Gets very mathy, but watch the last 10 minutes for sure. Video Red/black trees\nThese are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below). In practice: Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 (link jumps to starting point) (video) Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 (video) Red-Black Tree An Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree 2-3 search trees\nIn practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees). You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees. 23-Tree Intuition and Definition (video) Binary View of 23-Tree 2-3 Trees (student recitation) (video) 2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)\nIn practice: For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice. CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video) Bottom Up 234-Trees (video) Top Down 234-Trees (video) N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees\nnote: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches) binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2 2-3 trees are 3-ary K-Ary Tree B-Trees\nFun fact: it’s a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor). In Practice: B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file.

life.</p><p>When I started this project, I didn&rsquo;t know a stack from a heap, didn&rsquo;t know Big-O anything, or anything about trees, or how to
traverse a graph. If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible.
Every data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn&rsquo;t know how they worked
under the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an &ldquo;out of
memory&rdquo; error, and then I&rsquo;d have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and
thousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a long plan. It may take you months.

Sometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.</p><p>It would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources,
such as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people can study these anytime,
not just when a specific online course is in session.</p><h2 id=choose-a-programming-language>Choose a Programming Language<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#choose-a-programming-language>#</a></h2><p>You&rsquo;ll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do,

Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures
and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that&rsquo;s terrific,
but when you&rsquo;re learning how these low-level data structures are built, it&rsquo;s great to feel close to the metal.<ul><li>C is everywhere. You&rsquo;ll see examples in books, lectures, videos, <em>everywhere</em> while you&rsquo;re studying.</li><li><a href=https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628>The C Programming Language, Vol 2</a><ul><li>This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
you&rsquo;ll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.</li><li>You don&rsquo;t need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you&rsquo;re comfortable reading and writing in C.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/lekkas/c-algorithms>Answers to questions in the book</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it&rsquo;s just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.</li></ul><p>This is my preference. You do what you like, of course.</p><p>You may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:</p><ul><li><a href=https://exercism.org/tracks>Exercism</a></li><li><a href=http://www.codewars.com>Codewars</a></li><li><a href=https://codility.com/programmers/>Codility</a></li><li><a href=https://www.hackerearth.com/>HackerEarth</a></li><li><a href=http://www.spoj.com/>Sphere Online Judge (spoj)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.codechef.com/>Codechef</a></li><li><a href=https://codeforces.com/>Codeforces</a></li></ul><h3 id=for-your-coding-interview>For your Coding Interview<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#for-your-coding-interview>#</a></h3><p>You can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the interview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:</p><ul><li>C++</li><li>Java</li><li>Python</li></ul><p>You could also use these, but read around first.

You Won&rsquo;t Remember it All<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-you-wont-remember-it-all>#</a></h3><p>I watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn&rsquo;t remember. I spent 3 days going
through my notes and making flashcards, so I could review.

Use Flashcards<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-use-flashcards>#</a></h3><p>To solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.
Each card has different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.</p><p>Make your own for free:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards>Flashcards site repo</a></li></ul><p><strong>I DON&rsquo;T RECOMMEND using my flashcards.</strong> There are too many and many of them are trivia that you don&rsquo;t need.</p><p>But if you don&rsquo;t want to listen to me, here you go:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db>My flash cards database (1200 cards)</a>:</li><li><a href=https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db>My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards)</a>:</li></ul><p>Keep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics.
It&rsquo;s way too much for what&rsquo;s required.</p><p><strong>Note on flashcards:</strong> The first time you recognize you know the answer, don&rsquo;t mark it as known. You have to see the
same card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in
your brain.</p><p>An alternative to using my flashcard site is <a href=http://ankisrs.net/>Anki</a>, which has been recommended to me numerous times.
It uses a repetition system to help you remember. It&rsquo;s user-friendly, available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system.
It costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.</p><p>My flashcard database in Anki format: <a href=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560>https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560</a> (thanks <a href=https://github.com/xiewenya>@xiewenya</a>).</p><p>Some students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open deck, edit card, click cards, select the &ldquo;styling&rdquo; radio button, add the member &ldquo;white-space: pre;&rdquo; to the card class.</p><h3 id=3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-learning>3.

From what I can tell, these aren&rsquo;t used much in practice, but I could see where they would be:
The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly
balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it
attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language
dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNeL18KsWPc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb&index=6">MIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort (video)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/Qq5E0/avl-trees>AVL Trees (video)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/PKEBC/avl-tree-implementation>AVL Tree Implementation (video)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/22BgE/split-and-merge>Split And Merge</a></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Splay trees</strong></p><ul><li>In practice:

Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time.
Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications,
but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees;
for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and
the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java,
the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor
hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used</li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/1W3x0f_RmUo?list=PLFDnELG9dpVxQCxuD-9BSy2E7BWY3t5Sm&t=3871">Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 (link jumps to starting point) (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm2GHwyKF1o&list=PLFDnELG9dpVxQCxuD-9BSy2E7BWY3t5Sm&index=5">Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 (video)</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree>Red-Black Tree</a></li><li><a href=https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/An%20Introduction%20to%20Binary%20Search%20and%20Red-Black%20Trees>An Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree</a></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>2-3 search trees</strong></p><ul><li>In practice:

operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an
important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce
2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though <strong>2-4 trees are not often used in practice</strong>.</li><li><a href=https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_zqrqYXkth6Q>CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQdMYevEyE4&index=4&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6">Bottom Up 234-Trees (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2679VQ26Fp4&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6&index=5">Top Down 234-Trees (video)</a></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees</strong></p><ul><li>note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)</li><li>binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2</li><li>2-3 trees are 3-ary</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree>K-Ary Tree</a></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>B-Trees</strong></p><ul><li>Fun fact: it&rsquo;s a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).</li><li>In Practice:
B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to
its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary
block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block
(or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address</li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree>B-Tree</a></li><li><a href=http://btechsmartclass.com/data_structures/b-trees.html>B-Tree Datastructure</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I22wEC1tTGo&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6&index=6">Introduction to B-Trees (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3bCdZGrgpA&index=7&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6">B-Tree Definition and Insertion (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svfnVhJOfMc&index=8&list=PLA5Lqm4uh9Bbq-E0ZnqTIa8LRaL77ica6">B-Tree Deletion (video)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3omVLzI0WE&index=7&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61hsJNdULdudlRL493b-XZf">MIT 6.851 - Memory Hierarchy Models (video)</a>
